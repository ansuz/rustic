## rustic

A bunch of rust snippets, because I'm learning, and I might as well share.  
I'll probably be focusing on Rust's more functional features:  
* lambdas
* recursion
* currying

But anything that I think might be useful to someone else will likely get included.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ansuz/rustic.git
cd rustic
mkdir bin
./call <one of the files in the src directory>
```
