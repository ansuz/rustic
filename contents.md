# Contents

Let's lay out the repository:

I'll have three main folders:

1. blag // which I'll use to _blag_
2. src  // which I'll use to store snippets
3. lib  // which I'll use to store code intended for reuse

## src

This folder will be organized by functionality. So far, the only folder is `basics`, which will contain short programs meant to demonstrate some basic feature.

### basics

1. pewpew.rs 
  * "pewpew" is the new "hello world". tell your friends.
  * This is the most basic form of a complete Rust program, consisting only of a 'main' function.
  * It also demonstrates how Rust handles comments (block comments NEST)
